# TO-DO / Notes

- change visited link color to darker color that is still noticable

- dont change `a:link` but the selector that changes the un/visited links themselves

- change the card for `flex-grow: 1;` with the size allottment of 150px by 100px. then create the mobile version using media queries. Or just add a max size of 500px for a card.

- For the mobile version, the dimensions of the margain, padding, and borders will stay the same. The difference is that the cards will be stacked on top of each other in a column format. Then for landscape viewing, there will be 2 columns. 

- [ ] instead of an entire section dedicated to the title and subtitle of a card, put it inline with the rest of the card. [Testing Site](https://codesandbox.io/s/frosty-meadow-vt3xsk?file=/index.html)
